          20 scored a one. Four 
          students earned the college credits 
          from the exam</p>
          
          <p>Last spring, six students took 
          the AP exam for Art History 
          and all scored a one. Eleven 
          students took the AP Psychology 
          exam, and again all scored a one. Twenty-three students took the AP 
          exam for European History, three 
          students scored a three, earning 
          the college credits, and the other 
          20 scored a one. In AB Calculus, 
          18 students took the AP exam, 16 
          scored a one, one student scored 
          a two, and one student scored a 
          three, earning college credits. In 
          AP Physics, 11 students took the 
          exam, eight students scored a one 
          and three scored a two. </p>
          
          <p>Each AP exam score is a 
          weighted combination of the 
          student’s scores on the multiplechoice section and the free 
          response section. The final score 
          is reported on a five-point scale. 
          Obtaining a three is passing, 
          anything lower than a three is 
          failing and no college credit if 
          given. There aren’t many students 
          who have taken the AP exam and 
          passed with more than a two,” said 
          Mr. Gorman, assistant principal of 
          the Math and Science Department. 
          Nevertheless, he said, “It shows a 
          great deal of effort when a student 
          takes the class because it helps 
          develop academic scores.”</p>

          <p>Last year, Queens Voc offered 
          five AP classes: Psychology taught two biggest fundraisers were 
          senior Mildred Alvarez, who 
          raised $800 and freshman Philip 
          Papaccio, who raised $410. 
          “When I heard about the Breast 
          Cancer walk, I thought it would 
          be fun, but I didn’t think I’d raise 
          $410. I had a lot of fun, and it made me feel great because it was 
          for a good cause. I can’t wait for 
          next year,” said Phillip Papaccio.</p>
          
          <p>“Every year that I’ve 
          participated in the Breast Cancer 
          Walk, it has been more successful 
          than the previous year,” said 
          junior Tia Singh. “It’s just a fun 
          day walking to support people 
          that you don’t know personally. 
          Advocates who participate not 
          only help breast cancer, but they 
          help create a caring atmosphere,” 
          she said.</p>
